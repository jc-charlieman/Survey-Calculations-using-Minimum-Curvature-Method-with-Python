# Survey Calculations using Minimum Curvature Method with Python : Mexican Oil Well Example

Using 3 variables as input: depth(md), inclination(deg) & azimuth(deg) we calculate all the parameters which we normally find on a survey. Parameters like 
TVD, NS, EW, Vertical Section & Dog Leg Severity are computed. An example from a mexican oil field is presented, as well as the Python Code.
